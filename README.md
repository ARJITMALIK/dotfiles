Dotfiles are the customised configurations of some softwares, installed on your computer system to make your usage experience exactly how you want it. Dotflies, as the name suggests are files containing a period (.) infront of them (yeah! ofCourse they are hidden ðŸ˜‰). They are the files that you can configure to make your computer system fits according to your special needs. This repo contains some of my dotfiles so that you don't have to make it from scratch, just clone it, play around a bit and gift yourself a great looking and extremely functional environment.
